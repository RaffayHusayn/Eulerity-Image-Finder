<h1>Eulerity Take-Home Challenge</h1>

<h2>Description and Valid Inputs</h2>
<p>The crawler can crawl and scrape images for 4 different type of inputs.
    It also maintains individual caches for 50 entries of each category or 60 minutes.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>IMDb User Lists:</strong>  Crawler takes IMDb user list's URL as an input. Extract all the movie page URLs from the list.
        It then spins up 2 threads, each crawling 1 movie page URL. We iteratively call the first 10 URLs from the user
        list in a pair of 2. IMDb doesn't like a lot of requests simultaneously, so using more than 2 threads results
        in a temporary ban.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Unsplash Homepage:</strong> Crawler takes Unsplash's homepage URL as an input. Extract all the category page URLs.
        It then spins up a separate thread for each category, crawling and scraping images. Unsplash is much more
        crawler friendly and doesn't result in a ban for sending too many requests.
    </li>
    <li><strong>IMDb Movie Page:</strong> Crawler takes the movie page's URL, crawls to the photos section, and scrape images.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Unsplash Category Page:</strong> Crawler takes the unsplash category page's URL, crawls to each image, and scrapes it.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Multithreading.</li>
    <li>Caching, caches 50 entries for each type for upto 60 minutes using Guava Cache.</li>
    <li>Crawling to other specific URLs from a given URL to scrape correct images.</li>
    <li>Site Friendly, doesn't allow multiple requests which could result in a temporary ban.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Use the provided suggestions or type your own URLs. Crawling and Scraping
    IMDb is significantly slower because they don't allow a lot of requests simultaneously, so I
    can't leverage multithreading to its full potential.
